# Reaction Game

This is a reaction game made using Ruby2d and alongside the tutorial on youtube by Mario Visic. This is a reaction game testing the time it takes to click a randomly placed square on the screen. You have seven turns and it records your best score in milliseconds. I followed along the tutorial for the most part but added some of my own features as well such as how many turns left and adding the previous best 3 turns. 

This project was entirely coded in Ruby but does require the Ruby2d gem package.

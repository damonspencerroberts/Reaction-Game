# Reaction Game

This is a reaction game made using Ruby2d and alongside the tutorial on youtube by Mario Visic. This is a reaction game testing the time it takes to click a randomly placed square on the screen. You have seven turns and it records your best score in milliseconds. I followed along the tutorial for the most part but added some of my own features.

### These features include:
- User can choose 1 or 2 player mode
- User can input their names
- View shows how many turns player has left
- Previews the players best 3 scores and (2 player version) next player's turn.
- 2 Player mode the winner is chosen by the person who scored the least in the 7 turns.

*This project was entirely coded in Ruby and requires the Ruby2d gem package.*

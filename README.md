# Reaction Game

This is a reaction game made using Ruby2d and alongside the tutorial on youtube by Mario Visic. I followed along the tutorial for the most part but added some of my own features as well such as how many turns left and adding the previous best 3 turns. 

This project was entirely coded in Ruby but does require the Ruby2d gem package.
